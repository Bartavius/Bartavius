## Hi, I'm Bart ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer studying at Northeastern University with B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software. I greatly enjoy building websites as a Full-Stack Developer and learning about new random technologies along the way. Reach out to me! Especially if you know any techniques to making omurice or your controversial, favorite water brand.
