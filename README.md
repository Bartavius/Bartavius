# Hi, I'm Bart 


> I'm a student studying at Northeastern University with _B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software_. I greatly enjoy building websites as a Full-Stack Developer, and also pretty interested in distributed systems.

Reach out to me! Especially if you know any techniques to making omurice or your controversial, favorite water brand.
